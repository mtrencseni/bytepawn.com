I started maintaining a <a href="http://bytepawn.com/readings-in-distributed-systems/">list of papers on Distributed Systems</a>.
MARKER

Currently, there's a section on 
<ul>
<li>the Google papers: GFS, Bigtable, MapReduce, etc.: these are classics</li>
<li>Distributed Filesystems: this is what I'm working on right now, so it's the most complete section</li>
<li>Non-relational Distributed Databases: very incomplete</li>
<li>The Lamport papers: Leslie Lamport seems to be the godfather of distributed algorithms, these are some of his most important papers. It's worth looking at them to get an idea of the problems you could run into designing / implementing distributed systems.</li>
</ul>

If you think something important is missing, please <a href="http://bytepawn.com/about/">email me</a>.
