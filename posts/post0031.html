After I bought the Marathon MX a couple of months ago, I immediately didn't like, and <a href="http://bytepawn.com/2010/05/02/new-logitech-m705-marathon-mouse">wrote a blogpost about it</a>. I tried to get used to it, but my opinion has not canged since then. The Marathon MX is a poorly designed mouse.
MARKER

Shortly thereafter I went out to buy a new mouse for my Macbook Pro and got the Logitech MX Anywhere. It's not much more expensive than the Marathon, but boy, it beats it in any every department. The Anywhere is easily the best mouse I've ever owned. In fact it's so good, after I decided to buy Starcraft 2 to play on my workstation, I bought a second Anywhere to replace the hated Marathon. So I now own two of these, and absolutely have no regrets!

The Anywhere uses Logitech's darkside technology for movement detection (as does the Marathon) - my attitude as a user is a healthy "who cares". I've not had problems with precision or detection with previous mice either. It uses the tiny USB sticklet as a wireless station (as does the Marathon) which makes it a great notebook mouse. 

The Anywhere uses some new power saving technology from Logitech. The sales guy told me it will last for a whole year. Under regular everyday use, it actually goes for 4 months on 2 AA batteries, which compared to my previous mice is great.

The Anywhere's scroll wheel is a flywheel, which, when pushed switches to the old school ticked scroll mode. After months of use, I love scrolling on this mouse. Next to the scroll wheel is an additional middle button, which switches Expose under both Windows and Mac.  (Logitech implemented Expose as part of their driver package under Windows.)

The way the buttons click is great. They have just the right clickety-clack sound. Included in the package is a sweet baggy for you mouse.

Now, on to what I don't like. The back and forward buttons are somehow in the wrong position for my large hands. This problem is specific to my hand though, a friend who also bought an Anywhere has no complaints. So I've set the scroll wheel's left and right click to be back and forward, problem solved. The included software is pretty nice, although it duplicates some of the operating system functionality, which is a little bit confusing.

Overall, I like this mouse so much I'm considering buying a couple extra ones in case eventually Logitech stops selling them and mine break.
