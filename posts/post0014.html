<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton's</a> 1907 ad in London's Times, recruiting a crew to sail with him on his exploration of the South Pole:

<blockquote>
Wanted. Men for hazardous journey.<br/>
Low wages. Bitter cold.<br/>
Long hours of complete darkness.<br/>
Safe return doubtful.<br/>
Honor and recognition in the event of success.
</blockquote>

Would this kind of ad work on programmers?
