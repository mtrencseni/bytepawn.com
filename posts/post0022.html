SSD Reading List

As part of the preparatory work of replacing BerkeleyDB with our own storage engine in <a href="http://scalien.com">Keyspace</a>, I've been looking at papers about SSD technology. It looks like SSDs will replace spinning disks in a couple of years, and in anticipation of this we're looking into the possibility of optimizing the engine for its characteristics: cheap random reads, potentially expensive writes because of erases behind complex on-disk logic called the Flash Tranlation Layer (FTL). Here are some good resources I found.

</ol>

Two notes: First, the uFLIP paper is particularly good. Second, it seems that the In-Page Logging (IPL) paper assumes direct control of read/write/erase cycles of the SSD, which is not realistic for off-the-shelf consumer drives like the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=intel%20x25m&aq=f&oq=&aqi=">Intel X25-M</a>, which include a complex FTL.

Finally, while putting together this list I found a much <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jpq/flash.html">longer list of SSD papers here</a>, also worth taking a look.
